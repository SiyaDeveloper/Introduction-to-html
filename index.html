<!-- Paragraph about me -->
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> My name is Siyanda, and I am a student ambassador at TechBridle Foundation Academy ,where we focus on Software Development. My passion for programming began during my BSc thesis in Computer Science and Statistics in 2022. Since then, I have continued to grow my skills, including completing soft skills programs such as ALX Aice and Virtual Assistance. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical and interpersonal skills but also fueled my desire to contribute to meaningful solutions that make a positive impact. I am committed to leveraging this opportunity to help others and drive innovation in the tech community.
