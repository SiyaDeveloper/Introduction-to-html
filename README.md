# Introduction-to-html
My 1st Project @ Techbridle Academy  Built a clean HTML webpage using: ✔ Semantic structure (&lt;header>, &lt;footer>) ✔ Ordered/unordered lists ✔ Images with alt text ✔ Text formatting (headings, &lt;strong>)  No CSS/JS—pure focus on HTML basics! Learned document structure, accessibility, and content organization.
